# trunk-based-development
Guidance for repositories expected to follow the practice of trunk-based revision
control, adopted in February 2026 as a standard for all new code repositories
that do not have a pressing need to follow a different revision control process.

Trunk-based development is...

> A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code
> in a single branch, and resist any pressure to create other long-lived development
> branches.

As the model is widely documented we will try not to repeat any of the basic principles
here. If you would like an introduction to the concepts and best practices
the following resources may be of interest: -

1. [Atlassian] (Kev Zettler article)
2. [Trunk based development] (for the technically-minded)

Teams can adopt the pattern for [smaller teams] or [scaled] development as they see fit.

For advice, and further guidance for repositories please refer to [our wiki].
